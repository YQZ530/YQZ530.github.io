    <p>Humans assume different production roles in a workspace. On one hand,
humans design workplans to complete tasks as efficiently as possible in
order to improve productivity. On the other hand, a nice workspace is
essential to facilitate teamwork. In this way, workspace design and workplan
design complement each other. Inspired by such observations, we propose
an automatic approach to jointly design a workspace and a workplan. Taking
staff properties, a space, and work equipment as input, our approach jointly
optimizes a workspace and a workplan, considering performance factors
such as time efficiency and congestion avoidance, as well as workload factors
such as walk effort, turn effort, and workload balances. To enable exploration
of design trade-offs, our approach generates a set of Pareto-optimal design
solutions with strengths on different objectives, which can be adopted for
different work scenarios. We apply our approach to synthesize workspaces
and workplans for different workplaces such as a fast food kitchen and a
supermarket. We also extend our approach to incorporate other common
work considerations such as dynamic work demands and accommodating
staff members with different physical capabilities. Evaluation experiments
with simulations validate the efficacy of our approach for synthesizing
effective workspaces and workplans.</p>
