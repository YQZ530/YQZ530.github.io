    <p>With advances in consumer-grade virtual reality (VR) devices,
VR training gains unprecedented attention in research and industries.
Although the nature of VR training encourages trainees to actively
learn through exploring and gathering information in a simulated
virtual environment, designing effective virtual training environments is
non-trivial. We propose an adaptive approach that guides trainees to develop
psychomotor skills in a simulated virtual environment. As a showcase,
we demonstrate our novel approach for restaurant service using a
game-based VR application. By incorporating the trainee’s performance
and learning progress into optimization objectives, our approach uses
mixed integer programming (MIP) to generate VR training sessions iteratively.
Through collecting the trainee’s performance in VR training,
our approach adapts the VR training sessions by considering the trainee’s
strengths and weaknesses, guiding the trainee to improve over training
sessions. We validated our approach through two experimental studies.
In the first study, we compared our approach with a random training task
assignment approach and a performance-only MIP approach through
performing simulated restaurant service training. In the second study,
we compared our approach with the random assignment approach by
evaluating trainees’ skill developments in restaurant services. The results
show that our skill-driven adaptive training approach outperforms
the random assignment approach.</p>
